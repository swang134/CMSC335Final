App Description - One or two-line description.
So this application is a twitter-like personal mood album. The user can record their moods by where, when, and how it is via submitting a form. The database will store the result, and return it when the user searches the keyword. There is 2 way the user can get their records by inputting the mood (which will return multiple records) or by title (only return 1 record, assuming each title is unique). The user can also delete their records by title.
